# 👶Real-time Infant Monitoring System

A real-time infant monitoring system designed for Raspberry Pi. It combines deep learning-based audio analysis and computer vision to monitor a baby's safety and comfort in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔊 **Cry Detection**  
  Classifies audio into: Crying, Silence, Laugh, and Noise using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model trained on MFCC and spectrogram features.

- 🎥 **Video Monitoring**  
  Detects:
  - Sleep vs Awake (EAR-based with MediaPipe)
  - Face Covered / Face Down
  - Body Uncovered
  - Camera Obstruction (WIP)

- 🧠 **Optimized for Edge**  
  - Lightweight TorchScript model (`cry_model_torchscript.pt`)
  - Fast webcam and mic inference
  - Modular, plug-and-play design

## 📁 Key Files Explained

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dataset.py` | Defines the `CryDataset` class to load and return (feature, label) pairs from a CSV. Converts .npy feature files into PyTorch tensors. |
| `focal_loss.py` | Implements Focal Loss to handle class imbalance by focusing on hard samples. Improves cry detection for underrepresented classes. |
| `main.py` | Launches the entire system: audio-based cry detection and video-based monitoring using multithreading. |
| `model.py` | Defines `CryClassifier`: CNN + BiLSTM + Attention to capture spatial-temporal features from audio spectrograms. |
| `train.py` | Trains the cry detection model, saves checkpoints, evaluates metrics, and plots confusion matrix. |
| `video_monitor.py` | Uses webcam to monitor infant's sleep status, facial visibility, and posture using MediaPipe + Dlib. Integrates with audio cry detection alerts. |
| `preprocess_data.py` | Converts audio files to WAV, splits into 3-second chunks, and organizes them by label. |
| `extract_features.py` | Extracts mel-spectrogram and delta features from WAV audio files. Saves as .npy files and metadata CSV for training. |
